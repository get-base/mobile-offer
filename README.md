# Mobile Engineer @ Base

## We are looking for someone who is:
- Really passionate about mobile development. If you LOVE coding, designing architectures and discussing why framework A is better than framework B, Base is your team!
- Fast learner! At the end of the day we don't care if you are an expert in a given technology because we believe that the best engineers are curious about new technologies, smart, and learn fast.
- We get it, meetings sometimes are not fun but we are looking for someone that likes to get challenged, prioritize new tasks depending on user feedback and enjoys working on a team. 
- Passionate about the U.S. technology market. Our HQ is in NYC and our ideal candidate is really excited about coming to NYC once or twice a year (of course, all expenses paid by the company).
- You'd like to work with talent that comes from companies like Instagram, Facebook, Spotify, and others.
- Able to communicate in English. It's ok if it's not perfect as long as you manage to get your point across and you are willing to keep improving it once you join. 
- Bonus points if you have previous experience with Flutter.
